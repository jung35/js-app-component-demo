# Levelcredit Component Demo
While react component library is built with typescript, it compiles into CommonJS and includes definition types.

Here, we won't be using typescript but es6 with flow.

## Setting up
Assuming docker is installed already, just go ahead and run `bin/docker-start` to build container if it doesn't already exist.

Once the dependencies are installed, the webserver will start on `localhost` port `:9000`
